# Notes-From-Book-Driver-Dev
# Beginning a Driver Project
- Early PCs used Intel processors in "real mode" with 640 KB of memory and manual hardware configuration through DIP switches.
- Windows evolved from a graphical shell for MS-DOS to a full operating system with virtual device drivers (VxDs) for multitasking and hardware virtualization.
- Microsoft developed the Windows Driver Model (WDM) to unify driver development across different Windows versions, eliminating the need for real-mode drivers by the time of Windows 98/Me.
